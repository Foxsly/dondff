Task title: Add support for Docker
Task details:
I would like `backend` to be runnable via Docker, preferably using docker-compose.
This should also include support for the environment-specific databases.

Use the “Write Software Implementation Plan” guideline. Output only:

- Notes

Stop for review after drafting.
